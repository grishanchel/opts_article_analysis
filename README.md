# Stochastic Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise via Accelerated Gradient Clipping
This repository is made for stepwise analyzing of the [article]([https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/mishchenko22b.html](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10785)) 
introducing the ClippedSGD and ClippedSSTM algorithms.

The ultimate goal of the project is giving a presentation in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
